## Where to find the Sprites

VN-usable sprites are at `expressions/` and `sprites/`. 

For some  of our mascot that doesn't fit for VN usage and mostly for promotional usage is at `etc/`.

Keep in mind the `sayonika_nuxill_ver.png` asset is only included for historical purposes and not really used anywhere.
