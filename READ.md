## About the Press Kit

The press kit's aim is for you to use the standard colour ranges, usages of the logo, and Mascot assets optimally. 
These were created to familiarise you on the acceptable color range we use on our website designs and promotional content.

## Mascot

The Sayonika mascot is a mixture of Monika and Sayori, with a blue-green eye pallette and a combination of Sayori's hair color with Monika's hair style. The ribbon is red with white stripes on the ends.

You can find the full set of the  mascot sprites for VN usage or whatever purpose in `mascot/`.
